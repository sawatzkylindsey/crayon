# crayon
Crayon is a place for me to showcase different mini-projects, tools, visualizations, etc.
When deciding a name, I was visualizing a bucket full of colourful crayons.
It's chaotic and messy, but the colours draw you in and inspire creativity.
I'm hoping that idea is an appropriate metaphor for this project.
