        - "This is a fun visual encoding for names, or just words in general."
        - "Chances are you are familiar with this concept; there are a number of examples on the web.
        For myself, the first example I can think of is <a href='https://github.blog/2013-08-14-identicons/'>github's identicons</a>.
        The idea is to procedurally generate an image/icon/avatar based off the input word."
        - "Different encoding schemes might have different objectives, but with this one I wanted for each unique word to produce a unique rendering.
        This way, the encoding serves as a visual representation of your name!"
        - "This encoding lays the alphabet across a horizontal line from A to Z.
        Then, start filled curve at each character in the input name, and end the curve at the next character.
        Additionally, alternate from upwards curves to downwards curves, with the former coloured green and the later coloured blue.
        Finally, fade the colour as the name progresses, to give the perception of depth.
        The end result, I think, is something like a landscape of mountains and lakes."
        - "Feel free to play around and try out your name!
        As an exercise, try to figure out what the default visualized name is (without looking at the source code!)."
