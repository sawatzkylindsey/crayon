        - "My name is Lindsey Sawatzky and this is a simple website I've built for myself.
        When deciding a name for this project, I was imagining a bucket full of colourful crayons.
        It's chaotic and messy, but the colours draw you in and inspire creativity.
        I'm hoping that idea is an appropriate metaphor for this website."
        - "I'm building this for a few reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>
            As a fun way to demonstrate my work through an explorative CV.
          </li>
          <li>
            For my own personal enjoyment.
            I've liked making things my whole life, but in my youth I didn't know how to manifest my builder's desire.
            Ever since I realized programming was a viable outlet, I've always been programming one way or the other.
            This website is simply the next in a long line of personal builder's desire projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a way to explore new directions for my work.
            In recent years, I've stumbled upon diagrams & visualizations as a new facet to my creative desires.
            I would like to start publishing some of these pieces here.
          </li>
        </ul>"
        - "With that I hope you enjoy exploring.
        Happy hunting!"
